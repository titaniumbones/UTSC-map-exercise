# This Map Should Deal with a Historical Topic You Care About

Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

replace this text and the text with your essay. But be sure not to eliminate the html elements that
are contained inside this textarea, or [your map won't work at all!][1] [1](#one)

  <!-- these buttons hide/show all the markers  -->
  <!-- to hide/show blue or red markers instead, change my_markers below to blue_markers
       to red_markers.  If you have defined your own color (or other) arrays, use those instead -->

The rest of your essay should go under the map, probably.

etc. Be sure to [make use of links](http://digital.hackinghistory.ca) -- that's one of the reasons we write on the Web, and I've asked you to use links for all yor footnotes/references as well.
