# A Challenge to Orthodoxy

Of the events leading up to the [Second Deatheater War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Deatheater_War), none has a more central place in collective memory than the dramatic death of Albus Dumbledore, at that time the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Wizardry and Witchcraft, and among the most powerful wizards of the era. Few among us are unfamiliar with the broad outlines of this received history: Dumboledore, diagnosed with a fatal but slow-acting curse, engineered his own violent death in order to save the innocence of a troubled student, in the process setting in motion a complex train of events which would eventually lead to the defeat of [Tom Marvolo Riddle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Voldemort) and the Deatheater movement. In this quasi-Hegelian account, the most significant developments of the recent past are driven by a dialectical conflict between Dumboledore's compassionate genius and the starkly malignant power of Tom Riddle. This version of the story is repeated in textbooks, presented to the public in the abundant Dumbledore statuary adorning public spaces in wizarding communities, and reinforced through public remembrance ceremonies such as the annual [Albus Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albus_Day) celebrations.[^1]  

In the essay that follows, I use a detailed spatial reconstruction of Dumbledore's demise to illuminate a number of inconsistencies in the canonical narrative. Then, extrapolating from this spatial analysis and drawing on the works of Michel Foucault and Friedrich Kittler, I propose an alternate account of this period as an epistemic system in which "good" and "evil" organize a discursive field upon which deeply ingrained narratives play out.
