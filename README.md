# Digital History Portfolio Projects

Congratulations, you have finished all the "basic skills" assignments. All of the rest of the assignments for the rest of the year will live in a single repository -- this one.  Only the oral history assignment is required to pass the class. But those of you looking for a "B" will need to do the spatial history assignment, while those of you looking for an "A" will also need to do the project proposal.


These three assignments share some basic infrastructure.  This is on purpose.  If you do all three of them, you should be able to very easily turn this repository into a small "digital portfolio" showcasing your work for this class. Not all of you will want to do this, but it's nice to have the option.

I'll fill this README in with some further information as we go, but for now what you probably want is [a link to assignment 3](./spatial-history).

And doubtless also [a link to assignment 4](./oral-history).

[Assignment 5](./project-proposal) remains somewhat skeletally defined for now. 

## **PLEASE DO NOT MAKE CHANGES OUTSIDE OF ASSIGNMENT 3-RELATED FILES UNTIL I TELL YOU IT'S SAFE TO DO SO!**

## Viewing the Live Repo

It is **really easy** to flip a switch and make this repo go live! Near the top of this page you will see a :gear: gear icon -- this is the settings page. Navigate to that page and scroll odwn to the heading labeled `Github Pages`.  There's a drop-down menu there currently reading "none".  Click on the box and select `master branch` instead.  Moments later, your site will appear live at the URL now displayed in a blue box within ht eGithub Pages section.

That's it! You're Live! [You can read mroe about Github Pages here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/what-is-github-pages)

## Taking Control of Your Repo

At this point, you have a functioning website. If you want to keep it permanently as a personal website, you should probably assume contorl of it. You have two choices. 

- from the settings page (see above) scrol ldown to `Danger Zone` and choose `Transfer ownership`. Go through the multi-stage confirmation process. Once you're done, the repo will belong entirely to you -- there will no longer be a copy in the class Github Roganization. **You probably shouldn't do this before the end of the semster!**
- alternativley, just fork your repo using the `Fork` button near the top of the page on the **root page** of your repository (probably this page!). You will probably have to set publishing bakc up again -- see [viewing the live repo](#viewing-the-live-repo), above.
