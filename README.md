# Digital History Portfolio Projects

Congratulations, you have finished all the "basic skills" assignments. All of the rest of the assignments for the rest of the year will live in a single repository -- this one.  Only the oral history assignment is required to pass the class. But those of you looking for a "B" will need to do the spatial history assignment, while those of you looking for an "A" will also need to do the project proposal.

> I'm running a little behind schedule (surprise!) and so I will end up pushing some changes to all of your repos over the next coupe of weeks, but that should all happen more or less transparently.

These three assignments share some basic infrastructure.  This is on purpose.  If you do all three of them, you should be able to very easily turn this repository into a small "digital portfolio" showcasing your work for this class. Not all of you will want to do this, but it's nice to have the option.

I'll fill this README in with some further information as we go, but for now what you probably want is [a link to assignment 3](./spatial-history).

And doubtless also [a link to assignment 4](./oral-history).

[Assignment 5](./project-proposal) remains somewhat skeletally defined for now.
